# orders-distribution

##**I have created a Power BI overview dashboard**

I used different visualizations
-	Card visualizations to show number of orders, total sales, number of customers, number of employees
-	Bar charts to show number of orders by employee and total sales by category
-	Line chart to show number of orders by date with trend line 

To make the dashboard easy to interact with and filter I added slicer by date and slicer the impact of a price change on overall sales.
I added tooltips to the cards where you can see the month-to-month change, and drill through on category to analyze deeply orders per category.

Overall, the Power BI dashboard provides valuable insights into sales data, which can be used to make informed decisions about business.
